**This is a distributed system lab about Docker making a web app repository using PHP and MySQL.**

In this project, I made two containers. The first container is for the web app that include PHP code (use this Github Repo), the second container is the container for the database server using MySQL.

**How to use this Docker Project:**
1. docker pull timotiustimmy186/ubuntu-form:2.0 -> Prepare the ubuntu image to use the enviroment as the container for webapp registry form
2. docker pull timotiustimmy186/mysql:2.0 -> Prepare the myqsl image to use the enviroment as the container for MySQL Database server
3. Run Dockerfile inside the database directory in this repository
4. Execute timotiustimmy186/ubuntu-form:2.0
5. Enter ubuntu-form mode and start the apache2 services
6. All done.
